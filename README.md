# Taskboard-Updates
This code was created to update a taskboards functionality.  I wanted to be able to add tasks, update them, and remove them as necessary.

##Usage

This project can be used as a way to stay organized with the tasks that are assigned to you.

##Features

Tasks can be created that include title, description, and due date.  You are able to move them to three categories including "to do", "in progress", and "done".  

##Credits

I received guidance from my tutor, Robby Kurle.
